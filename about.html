            <h2>Know More About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi! My name is Ahmad Affandi Nurzaman. You can call me AAN. I was born in July 2005. I am from Southeast Asia and embrace a philosophy of freedom – free to see, read, write, and explore many things to continuously learn. I don't confine myself to a single profession; instead, I'm genuinely interested in learning new things and transforming them into memorable experiences. I enjoy working in a team, valuing collaboration and eager for opportunities to learn from experienced professionals, expand my network, and broaden my horizons.</p>
            <p>I have the knowledge and skills honed from a creative studies program, specializing in crafting compelling and effective visual solutions. I strongly believe that every design tells a story, and I am passionate about helping clients bring their vision to life through great visual work. I am proficient in the Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator) and am used to adhering to strict brand guidelines and deadlines. Through this I have also learned about photography, video editing, and even creating motion graphic animations.</p>
            <p>Beyond design, I've also completed training in automotive, gaining insights into component functions, inspection procedures, and vehicle maintenance methods.</p>
            <p>I am also studying Japanese for a process of going to work in Japan independently. I study every detail independently. Starting from reading articles about culture and life in Japan. Writing and memorizing hiragana, katakana, kanji. Speaking and listening exercises. I do everything independently because to join an institution, it requires a very large cost.</p>
            <p>I spend my time for learning. Learning from someone who is more experienced in their field. From a job, Internship, Webinar, Training, or even from a project that I work on.</p>
